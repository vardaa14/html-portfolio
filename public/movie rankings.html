<h1>The Best Movies According to Varda</h1>
<h2>My Top-3 Movies of All-time.</h2><hr/>
<h3>Monte-Carlo</h3>
<h4><p>This movie was produced like an old classic but was actually made in 2011. It has been my 'comfort movie' ever since I became familiar with the concept. </p></h4>
<h3>Eat Pray Love</h3>
<h4><p>This movie is a classic and the book the movie is based off is my absolute favourite.This book awakened my spirtual self. Hence, I will always like the book/movie. Also the casting is genius(i love Julia Roberts).</p></h4>
<h3>Five Feet Apart</h3>
<h4><p>This movie is also based off a book. While I am not a big rom-com fan, I thoroughly enjoyed this particular one. Not sure if it even counts as a rom-com, but the part that won me over was the ending. I was bawling for hours.</p></h4>
